// In any language strings are very powerfull

// There are many ways to create a string in JS.

// 1) Directly declaring string
const str = "newString"

// 2) Using new keyword
const newStr = new String("String using new keyword")

// In second syntax of declaring strings, an object of String class is created with value provided in parenthesis.
// This syntax stores each character as a key-value pair, means the position of character will be key and the character is value itself.
/*********************REMEMBER: The strings are stored as object not as array.****************/

// We can have many methods on strings.
